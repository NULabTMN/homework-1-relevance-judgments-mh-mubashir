                  LONDON*. Sept. 2.— Sir Robert
                  Ball,, former astronomer of the
                  royal observatory, now profes
                  sor of astronomy at Cambridge uni
                  versity and one of the most distin
                  guished British scientists, has writ
                  ten the following statement for The
                  Call on what the discovery of the
                  north pole means:
                  . . By SIR ROBER BALL
                  Two questions being asked all
                  over the ciyilied world today are:
                  . First; Why does any one want to^
                  go 'to the north pole? Second:
                  How does he know when he's
                  there?.
                  To answer the second question
                  first, the mariner who finds his
                  latitude in the northern hemi
                  sphere to be 90 degrees knows he
                  can be nowhere else than at the
                  north pole.
                  The astronomer will tell you
                  that to any one standing at the
                  north pole the sun rises and sets
                  only once a year — six months
                  daylight, six months night, miti
                  gated only by a little twilight at
                  the beginning and end of a period
                  of awful gloom, broken by occa- ;
                  * sional moonlight or aurora.
                  ' The pole is truly a unique spot
                  on the globe.- Cook, \u25a0 standing
                  there, faced due south. Which
                  ever way he looked he was more
                  -than 20 miles nearer the center
                  of the earth than if he stood at
                  the. equator. His weight was
                  greater than anywhere else i on
                  the surface of the globe. A
                  plumbline in his hand pointed ver
                  tically upward to the pole of the
                  heavens, around which all stars
                  revolve. Half of the stars he
                  could never see, the other half
                  never, went below his, horizon and
                  would have been visible through
                  out the six months of night.
                  The famous constellation Orion
                  • ever  circled around and around
                  his horizon. The pole star stood
                  directly over his head.

                  LONDON, Sept. 3.— Doctor Cook**
                  narrative of his thriving journey to
                  the north- pole, while it has not re
                  moved .the doubts raised as to his
                  having- really accomplished the fact,
                  has at- least set at rest the improbable
                  suggestions advanced in some quar

                  terview at Christiania on this pont
                  "Such a position is nonsense. Th«
                  magnetic pole is situated on the Amer
                  ican side and it is quite impossible
                  that- Drl, Cook could have been driven
                  sofar from his planned route. I know
                  Dr. Cook to be absolutely discreet and
                  reliable. 'It'will be necessary' to await
                  his arrival at Copenhagen for the
                  facts."

                  The. London newspapers are- not
                  wholly convinced by the narrative, and
                  persist that it will be necessary to

                  hopod that the result of his years of

                  will go far In the eyes of the world
                  I to clear up the question whether such

                  Peary from what I know of him

                  tempts to reach the North Pole there

                  breaking race between the two ex

                  found tho North Pole April 21 100S I
                  and after a Journey of terrible hard
                  ships he made his winter quarters
                  Jut about a year ago near Etah from
                  which place he bail started for the
                  pole From preliminary reports it is
                  believed that Peary reached Etah last
                  fall and after remalnjijg In the winter
                  lht > northern shore of Grnntlnnd ho
                  started on his dash fqr the pole last
                  February
                  According to one ofbis messages re
                  ceived here yesterday Peary located
                  the North Pole April 6 last almost
                  a rear after Dr Cook surveyed It
                  His retreat from the pole apparently
                  was not hampered by tho difficulties
                  which Dr Cook met because It is be
                  lieved that when ho reached Etah dur
                  ing the present summer ho was in
                  formed that Dr Cook had already dis
                  covered the North Pole that he had
                  been in winter quarters near there
                  and a few days previously he had I
                  started for civilization with his great
                  news By that time the Pear relief
                  ship Jeannie had reached Etah and i
                  Commander Pear on board the Roose
                  velt which had wintered at Etah
                  started south as far as ho could go In
                  the hopo of submitting his claim of
                  success to tho world before Dr Cook
                  This is indicated by the fact that ho
                  and his party put in at Indian Harbor
                  Labrador where they were not ex I
                  pected There is nq cablo or tele

                  While the messages from tho Peary
                  party have been exceptionally brief
                  so far it is believed by Herbert L
                  Bridgman secretary of the Peary Arc
                  tic club that after filing his news
                  paper story at Chateau Bay Labrador
                  Commander Peary and his party will
                  proceed with all speed to this city
                  where they should arrive within fie
                  days I I
                  Dr Cook has announced that he will
                  sail for this country September 23 and
                  it is possible that Instead of two sep
                  arate welcoming demonstrations there
                  will bo one grand celebration of their
                  return
                  The consensus of opinion now seems
                  to be that both men reached the North
                  Pole and that Dr Cook was there al
                  most a year before Peary and that tho
                  latter because of his superior equip
                  ment was able to gel out of the frozen
                  country in a years less time than it
                  required Dr Cook
                  It Is probable that their return to
                  this country may be mado a feature
                  of the Fulton H dson celebration
                  which Is to be held the latter part of
                  this month and the first of October
                  Dr Cook has not forgotten John R
                  Bradley the New York man who fin
                  anced his successful adventure Mr
                  Bradley has received i the following

                  a third to establish bases ot supplies

                  and deals chiefly with Cooks claim
                  to having reached the polo on April
                  21 1903 It says In part
                  The announcement that the North
                  Pole that lure of the century has ac I
                  tually been reached comes so sud
                  denly and from a quarter so unexpect I
                  ed that intelligent judgment on the
                  fact is difficult Naturally writing for I

                  statement of scientific results or data
                  would be deferred But Dr Cook
                  would probably not demand that scien
                  tific rank and weight should be given
                  to his expedition It was simply a
                  duel with naturoman stripped for the

                  claim and shall attest the result
                  And therefore Dr Cook will doubt
                  less be only too willing to offer the
                  data upon which the confirmation of
                  the narrative will rest Records diar

                  w Again to-day the officials of the Coast and
                  Geodetic Survey indicated their willingness to
                  arbitrate the dispute that has arisen on the
                  rival contentions of Peary and Cook. Up to the
                  present time, however. th»re has been no official
                  request for such action.
                  NO REPORT TO SURVEY REQUIRED.
                  Commander Peary. while missioned to
                  Snake certain observations for the Coast and
                  Cieodetic Survey, is not required to submit a
                  report It that hureau. He will undoubtedly
                  ' submit the results of the soundings and observa
                  tions of tidal action to the survey hut the eu
                  jwrintendent of the survey l.an no power to
                  require a full report. This win probably be

                  REGRET PEARY ATTACK
                  DR. COOK GAINS FRIEXDS.
                  Interest in Commander's Story Over
                  shadowed by Controversy.
                  Interest In Commander Peary's detailed account
                  of his progress to the North Pole was overshad
                  owed again yesterday by the controversy us to
                  whether Peary or Dr. Cook was the. first to reach
                  the pole. The naval officer's reiteration of the
                  Brooklyn physician's untrustworthlness, as ex
                  pressed In his dispatch from Battle Harbor, dated
                  on Friday, served only to stir up the debate.
                  Commander Peary* statement said: "Dr. Cook
                  has not b*«n at the pole en April 21. 190$. or at any
                  other time. He has simply handed the public a
                  gold brick." As a result of this those who, have
                  consistently asserted their belief in Dr. cook were
                  more vigorous In their support of him. Men In
                  terested in polar exploration who have tried to
                  remain neutral were inclined to think that Com
                  mander Peary had made a grave mistake in hasten
                  ing to denounce his rival without producing proof
                  of his assertions at the same time.
                  On the whole, the latest dispatch from Com
                  mander Peary branding Dr. Cook's story as a fabri
                  cation appeared to have turned public sentiment in
                  favor of the doctor. Even Peary's friends T\ere
                  chagrined that be had let his Indignation overcome
                  his common sense, as one man put it. While they
                  could account readily for the feeling which
                  prompted him to send such a message, they felt
                  that the general public would not be so likely to
                  condone the apparently ungenerous attack on a
                  rival.
                  Members of the Arctic Club of America, who have
                  been preparing to f»te Dr. Cook on his arrival in
                  New York next week went right ahead with their
                  arrangements. Dr. Ronwell O. Stebbine. chairman
                  of the executive committee of the club, had a con
                  ference with Mrs. Cook last evening, at which the
                  date for the club's dinner for the explorer was set
                  for Thursday evening. September 23. UTS. Cook
                  promised to use all her Influence to pet her hus
                  band tp accept the invitation for the dinner, which
                  promises to be a far more elaborate affair than at
                  first planned.
                  Captain Bradley S Oshon. secretary of the club,
                  continued to receive applications bath for the din
                  ner and for tickets on the steamboat, which will
                  be chartered to take Dr. Cook's friends down the
                  bay to meet the Okar 11. Bo fast are the applica
                  tions pouring in that Captain Osbon said the club
                  easily could till three excursion steamers. Brook
                  lyn neighbors of Dr. Cook have asked that two
                  hundred tickets be reserved for them. The Brook
                  lyn people want to take Dr. Cook off the liner at
                  Quarantine and make a triumphal sea and land
                  procession of It to his home In BusßWtek avenue.
                  Captain Ofbon received many letters yesterday
                  from persons In various parts of the United States
                  expressing their belief In Dr. Cook. Sherburn M.
                  Becker, the "Boy Mayor" of Milwaukee from 1904
                  to IS*'S. wrote from Atlantic City as follows:
                  I'm with Dr. Cook first, last and all the time.
                  Cook is a hero and a gentleman. Peary, if he
                  reached the pol« after Dr. Cook. Is no greater than
                  any one else who might do the same tiling.
                  Samuel S. Whitehouse, once a candidate for the
                  Supreme Court bench in Kings County, wrote:
                  1 believe Dr. Cook to be the real hero of the
                  North Pole. Peary, from his dispatches, if they
                  be true. Is acting like an us and making himself
                  ridiculous before, the whole world.
                  "While I believe Peary may have reached the
                  Dole," Captain Ofbon said, "his dispatches simply
                  confirm the opinion I formed from those he first
                  sent attacking Dr. Cook— that Is, he is certainly
                  fast approaching the height of Idiocy." J. Knowles
                  Hare, another member of the club, paid: "Captain
                  Osbon's statement expresses my sentiments."
                  Dr. Stehbins. when asked what he thought of
                  Peary's "gold brick" dispatch, said: "I don't think
                  Peary has any more proof about cook's failure to
                  reach the pole than he had at first. In fact, the
                  chances for his making good his assertions are
                  lewtenlng every day. and confidence in Dr. Cooks
                  story is steadily Increasing."

                  following dlepatch from Indian Harbor was re
                  ceived:

                  days coaling. Expect to reach Sydney about the
                  loth. Have one hundred walrus skins on board for

                  polar commission. PEAR*.
                  From the last sentence it was supposed that
                  Peary would recommend to the government that
                  a commission be appointed to determine the terri
                  torial supervision over the pole.
                  Mrs Frederick A. Cook. who has refused to
                  make any statement for publication on her hus
                  band's report that he reached the North Pole ahead
                  of Commander Peary, consented last night, through
                  a friend, to account for her silence.
                  '•I believe In my husband," she said, "and there
                  the matter ends for me. I do not belong in tills
                  controversy, and I have feared that if I talked at
                  all. no matter how guardedly. I should b» dragged
                  into It willy-nilly. Then there would be denials
                  and counter denUls. and I should never get clear.
                  For this reason I have, paid and shall Bay nothing
                  whatever beyond the bare affirmation that I believe

                  French Scientist ft Xot Inclined to
                  Discuss the Rival Cases.
                  [By CaN* to Th« Tribunal
                  Paris. Sept. 11.— French scientists suspend
                  their Judgment In the controversy «n the ground
                  that neither Dr. Cook nor Commander Peary
                  has yet produced scientific or legal evidence
                  that lie reached the North Pole. The question
                  If regarded here as subjudice. and it is felt that
                  it would be unfair and altogether premature to
                  express opinions which, in the absence of astro
                  nomical records and facts, could only be guess
                  ■work. No one. however, doubts the good faitli
                  of both Cook and Peary, and as Louis Liard,
                  vice-rector of the Academy of Paris and Mem
                  ber of the Institute, point* out. both claimants
                  should be credited until their evidence has been
                  scrutinised by s^me impartial Jury of scientific
                  men. who alon« are competent to pronounce
                  judgment. If. Liard hopes that both Cook and
                  Peary have been able to take photographs of the
                  stars, which could readily be verified by astron
                  omers, thereby furnishing conclusive proof of
                  the exact point where the photographer stood at
                  the precise moment of taking the photographs.
                  Alfred Crolset, dean or" the faculty of letters
                  of the University of Paris, also inclines to the
                  belief that both explorers have reached the pole,
                  and. like his colleagues, awaits anxiously accu
                  rate, detailed evidence. He says that the un
                  certain and contradictory figures and apparent
                  flaws In the statement of both Cook and of P^ary
                  and their vague assertions may he due to hasty
                  Writing or to errors in telegraphic transmission,
                  and will no doubt be made ciear under a final
                  p crosn-«»xamtnation
                  Maurice Loir, the French naval expert, at
                  taches importance to the fact that even th«
                  location of th* pole ag given by Cook may be
                  two, three or even five miles distant from the
                  Peary North Pole. The point calculated by the
                  best sextants user! by naviatlng officers, such as
                  the two explorers probably had with them, are
                  Incapable of the absolute accuracy that can he
                  obtained only by the delicate instruments of pre
                  cision used in astronomical observatories.
                  Pome of to-day's newspapers doubt whether
                  either explorer reached the North Pole. The
                  "Eclair." for instance, says that Commander
                  Peary is as fully as obscure and sensational as
                  is Dr. Cook, and lays stress on «he likelihood of
                  the personal errors of a man taking observations
                  under the difficult conditions of the
                  Polar regions Consequently, the results can at
                  the best be only approximate, so that, notwith
                  standing the strict good faith of the two claim
                  ants, it may eventually turn out that the quar
                  rel may take Its place aloneside the problem of
                  the Man in the Iron Mask, the Queen's neok

                  continues unabated, but Commander Peary's reit
                  erated charges have somewhat disconcerted the
                  newspapers, which now are much more Inclined to
                  suspend final Judgment until proof is submitted
                  Some of the papers treat the affair In a humorous
                  vein, and ask whether It is not possible that both
                  are Muffins. They point out especially that there
                  is nothing in Peary's recital Inconsistent with the
                  •tat«ment made by Cook, and that neither had a
                  white man with him at the pole. In scientific cir
                  cles intense regret la expressed that a great
                  achievement should be marred by a quarrel.
                  No one doubts Fearys success, but even those
                  who from .lie first were skeptical regarding Dr.
                  Cook severely condemn Peary's action In branding

                  Laughter and Regret Over Squabble
                  Between Explorers.
                  [By French Cable to The Tribune.]
                  London, Sept. 11.— The commonest English
                  comment on polar polemics is that as soon as
                  Americans do something really great they spoil
                  it by getting into personal squabble and abus
                  ing each other. There was hearty admiration
                  for Dr. Cook and Commander Peary in turn
                  when they reported the success of their hazard
                  ous and difficult conquest of nature in the high
                  est latitudes, but Englishmen are now laughing
                  outright over the wrangle between the two ex
                  plorers, precisely as they smiled over the naval
                  feuds arising out of the victory off Santiago.
                  Americans residing abroad, instead of receiv
                  ing congratulations from foreigners over the
                  heroic exploits of their countrymen, are sub
                  jected to good natured chaff over the bad man
                  ners of their heroes and -the vagaries of news
                  paper partisanship in a matter requiring scien
                  tific investigation and impartial judgment.
                  Dispatches from America state that English
                  opinion Is wholly on the side of Peary, and that
                  Cook is generally condemned ax an impost
                  This is sheer nonsense. Commander Peary is
                  known here and liked by scientific men, while
                  Dr. Cook can only be taken at his own word
                  until his records are recovered and his proof?
                  submitted to experts of high authority. There
                  is. however, unmistakable sympathy for Dr.
                  Cook, as the under dog. and this is coupled
                  with regret that Peary, instead of reporting his
                  own exploits, attacked his rival in a savage way
                  and sought to prejudice the world against him.
                  A wag remarks that while the pole has bet
                  found without doubt by one American or an
                  other, the first use of it lias been to hang up
                  soiled linen on it in place of the flag. I. N. F.

                  nan for the moment practically been dropped from
                  the editorial columns of the London newspapers.
                  and the only comment appearing this afternoon is
                  a paragraph In "The Pall Mall Gazette." which

                  reality, and in a way it contrasts vividly with the
                  unconvincing narrative of his rival. After readina

                  manner of telling it.
                  The claims and the counter claimr of the rival
                  explorers, however, have prominence on the news

                  •This message from Commander Robert E.
                  Peary was received to-day at the Sydney Hotel
                  by Mrs. Peary, who is waiting for the return of
                  her husband from the north. The explorer's
                  message was sent from Battle Harbor. Labra

                  her here, and Is the first definite word as to
                  when he will arrive in this city.
                  As the hours before she will again greet her
                  husband on his return from the north grow
                  fewer in number they seem to grow longer to
                  Mrs. Peary, and to make them pas* more quickly
                  John Kehl. American Consul here, and his wife
                  have been doing all in their power. To this end
                  an informal reception was given by Mrs. Kehl
                  to Mrs. Peary and her daughter. Marie, to-day at
                  the Kehl home. No. 59 Park street.
                  Arrangements have been made for Miss Prary,
                  Herbert L Bridgman and Consul Kehl to go
                  down the bay to meet the returning explorer on
                  the cable ship Tynan, which has been placed at
                  the disposal of the newspaper correspondents by
                  William Fugsley. Minister of Public Works for
                  the Dominion of Canada. It has been arranged
                  that Miss •Peary shall be first to board the
                  Roosevelt, and have a. moment with her father
                  before he sees the correspondents and repre
                  sentatives of the Peary Arctic Club.
                  The tug Douglas Thomas, chartered by The
                  Associated Press, left here last night with a
                  party of correspondents on board for Battle
                  Harbor. It will take about two days to make
                  the trip.
                  Mrs. Peary and her party, accompanied by the
                  visiting newspaper men, went to the steel plant
                  here this morning and this afternoon took an
                  automobile drive about the city.
                  Nothing additional was received here to-day
                  concerning the movements of Commander Peary
                  at Labrador, and if ie now accepted that lie will
                  remain at Battle Harbor until he gets his dis
                  patches through.
                  The committee having the reception arrange
                  ments in hand has about completed its work.
                  The demonstration will be the greatest of its
                  kind ever witnessed here, Canadians as well as
                  American visitors being enthusiasts- over
                  Peary's success. Sydney has a warm interest
                  in the explorer and will express it in no uncer
                  tain manner.

                  Peary in a dispatch to "The Post" from Battle
                  Harbor, Labrador, dated September 10. says:
                  The Roosevelt will remain here three or four
                  days coaling and overhauling ship. I expect to
                  arrive at Sydney about September 15.
                  Do not trouble about Cook's story or attempt
                  to explain any discrepancies in his statements.
                  The affair will settle itself.
                  He has not been at the pole on April 21, 1908.
                  or at any other time. He has simply handed the
                  public a gold brick.
                  These statements are made advisedly and I
                  have proof of them. When he. makes a full
                  statement of his journey over his signature to
                  some geographical society or other reputable
                  body, it' that statement contains the claim that
                  he has reached the^ole. I shall be In a position
                  to furnish material that may prove distinctly in
                  teresting reading for the public.

                  Some of Peary's freinds talk as
                  ifi^hey thought he had a prior right
                  to. discover the North Pole and that
                  no: one else shpuld attempt it un¬
                  til he igave it up.
                  st is a good thing for Dr. Cook
                  Chat Teddy no longer reigns at
                  - ..Wijtshsngton. If Teddy was .in the
                  saddle still be would soon decide
                  wbjo discovered the North Pole first,
                  and. as he is a patron of Peary, Cook
                  would be told to take a back seat.
                  Cook Got There First.
                  We have no doubt but what Dr.
                  Cook was the first man that ever
                  reached the North Pole, as he claims
                  to , have-done. It is to be regret¬
                  ted that any controversy should
                  spring up between Cook and Peary
                  about the matter, but it must be
                  borne in mind that Dr. Cook is not
                  at all responsible for it. He has
                  conducted himself in a modest, be¬
                  coming mmanner since he returned
                  to civilization and startled the world
                  by the announcement that he had
                  finally reavhed the North Pole. On
                  the other hand, Peary signalled his
                  return to civilizaton wth the annourcement that he was the first to
                  reach the Pole and that Cook had

                  demeanor indicates a disappoint¬
                  ment, but his .attempt to dit.cteJ.it
                  Cook will fail.
                  Among the members of the Amer¬
                  ican Geographical Society in Nf w
                  York it is believed that the exciting news of the last ten days from
                  Cook and Peary has been the culmi¬
                  nation of a record-bre?king race be¬
                  tween the two explorers from the
                  "top of the world" to the first tele¬
                  graph wires which might bring them
                  fame and fortune. They think that
                  Cook found the North Pole on April
                  21, 1908, and after a journey of
                  terrible hardships he made his win¬
                  ter quarters just about a year ago
                  near Etah, Northwest Greenland,
                  from which place he had started for
                  the Pole. In other words, they give
                  Cook credit for all he claims.
                  From preliminary reports it is
                  believed that Peary ijeached Etah
                  last fall and after remaining in the
                  winter quarters which he had es¬
                  tablished on the northern shore of
                  Grant Land, he started on his dash
                  for the Pole last February, Accord¬
                  ing to one of his messages Peary
                  located the North Pole on April 6
                  last, almost a year after Dr. Cook
                  surveyed it. His retreat from the
                  Pcle apparently was not hampered
                  by the difficulties which Dr. Cook
                  met because it is believed that when
                  he reached Etah during the present
                  summer he was informed that Dr.
                  Cook had already discovered the
                  North Pole that he had been in win¬
                  ter quarters near there and that
                  he had started for civilization with
                  his great news.
                  By that time the Pearv ship
                  Jeanie had already reached Etah and
                  Commander Peary, on board the
                  Roosevelt, which had wintered at
                  Etah, started south as fast as he
                  could go in the hope of submitting
                  his claim to the world before Cook.
                  This is indicated by the fact that he
                  and his party put in at Indian Har¬
                  bor, Labrador, whcie they were not
                  expected. There is no cable or tel¬
                  egraph line from there, but his
                  messages were sent from there by
                  wireless to New Foundland. Cook
                  beat Peary only about five days,
                  which he could have doubled, no
                  doubt, had he known that Peary
                  was racing to get the public ear
                  ahead of him.
                  In the light of the above facts,
                  the concensus of opinion seems to
                  be that both men reached the North
                  Pole and that Cook was there almost
                  a year before Peary, and that the
                  latter, because of his superior equip¬
                  ment, was- able to get out of the
                  frozen country in a year's less time
                  than it required Cook. The above
                  explains why Peary tried to dis¬
                  credit Cook as soon as he reached
                  a place where he could get a mes¬
                  sage to the United States. He
                  knew that he had been beaten by
                  Cook in the race for the North Pole
                  and he hated his succesful rival.
                  But it will do Peary more harm
                  than Cook, as the world has ac¬
                  cepted the latter's story as true un¬
                  til he verifies it with scientific data,
                  which we are sure he can do.

                  WHITE STAR LINE TO BUILD
                  BIGGEST SHIPS YET PROJECTED
                  By Associated Press.
                  LIVERPOOL. April Two new
                  White Star liners which will be the
                  largest vessels yet projected will be
                  laid down at Belfast next June. The
                  exact measurements of the steamers
                  have not been given out/but they will
                  be over 840 feet In length, 78 feet in
                  breadth and with a gross tonnage of
                  45,000, or 50,000.
                  The ships are to be fitted with com
                  bination turbines and reciprocating
                  engines guaranteed to maintain a
                  speed of twenty-one knots. The names
                  of the vessels are to be Olympic and
                  Titanic.

                  Soon after the two fast Cunarders. too Lusl-
                  I taria and the Mauretania, had demonstrated that
                  I one could travel in luxury and at a very high
                  i speed through tha agency of turbine engines. th«
                  White Star X-in» announced that it would build
                  two steamers to beat the Oinarders la length and
                  breadth, and perhaps In other ways also. It was
                  reported at the tim» that th« new Whlta Star
                  ■ liners would be a thousand feet in length, but sub
                  sequently it was officially announced that they
                  i would bo 900 feet lons, with a beam of ninety feet.
                  j When It was decided to build them it was found
                  ' that there was no gantry In thm world big enough
                  ! to accommodate such monsters, and It was then
                  . that Hrland  Wolff began to rip up three of Its
                  ', largest gantries and build the hug* steel and con
                  ' crete cradle that Is now ready to bold th* Olympic
                  • and the Titanic.
                  Before th* steel structure which supports th*
                  i powerful electric travailing cranes was erected a
                  ' big concrete base, twenty fret thick, was built upon
                  sp!le3 driven fifty fe«t into tha ground. The con
                  crete foundation, in addition to being more firm
                  than the regular earthen base, has the advantage
                  of cleanliness, an 1 tools and materials which mar
                  fall from the cranes la the course of construction
                  may be found more readily. Parts of deck fittings

                  The construction of the Olympic has been started.

                  TWO XEW GIAXTS OF SEA.
                  The Titanic and the Olympic W3l
                  lie Largest Steamships in World.
                  Although what will be the largest two steamships
                  In the world, the Titanic and the Olympic, of the
                  White Star Line, are mere skeletons just now in
                  their Lie million-dollar double gantry at Belfast,
                  Ireland the marine architects know exactly bow
                  they are going to look when they start on their
                  maiden passage to this port. From the plans and
                  specifications the designers have made a wush
                  drawing showing bow 'he monsters will look when
                  In the water and ready to sail. Although at nrst
                  glance the illustration suggests the Isauretania and
                  Lusitania. with their four gigantic funnels, there
                  Is something in the appearance of the new levia
                  thans that Is typical of a White Star steamship.
                  The great height of the new liners and the broad
                  sweep of the bridge elves some idea of their 80.J80
                  tons displacement. The builders have almost elimi
                  nated the old cusr im of carying masts, «nd In this
                  respect the targesi ships in the world resemble the
                  Old Dominion steamers, tha smallest passenger
                  carrying vessels in the American coastwise service.

                largest and finest, vessels in the world
                These massive ships are also notable

                  TITANTIC SAILS ON
                  HER FIRST VOYAGE
                  White Star Liner the Largest
                  Vessel that Ever Sailed
                  the Seas.
                  (National News Association)
                  LONDON, April 10. Carrying 1400
                  passengers the liner Titanic of the
                  White Star line, than which there is
                  no larger vessel afloat, sailed from
                  Southhampton today on her maiden
                  voyage bound for New York. The Tt
                  tanic which is of 45,000 tons displace
                  ment Is sister ship to the Olympic.
                  All the special suites of rooms in
                  stituted as an innovation in the Titan
                  ic were occupied when the passage be
                  gun. These suites consist of bed
                  rooms, sitting room, bath room, and
                  servant's room and have their own
                  private deck promenade isolated from
                  the rest of the ship and not overlooked
                  by any other passengers.
                  The Titanic also possesses another
                  new feature in its Louis XVI. restaur
                  ant. Her sister ship the Olympic, also
                  has this feature but on a smaller
                  scale. It proved so popular, however,,
                  that the White Star company decided
                  to have Jhe one on the Titanic greatly
                  enlarged. Adjacent to it is a special
                  reception room for the use of passen
                  gers taking meals in the restaurant.
                  The Titanic while its engineering
                  principal is the same as that of the
                  Olympic, is expected by experts on
                  navigation to make faster time than
                  the Olympic because of a slight dif
                  ference in the curvature of the propel
                  ler blades.

                  Belfast, Oct, 20. An ocean ateamer
                  that will rank among the wonders of
                  the world was to be launched today
                  at the yards of llarland Wolff in
                  this city. The steamship is the Olympic and - close by. is. her sister ship
                  the Titanic, which will also soon be
                  ready to take her initial plunge in the
                  deep. .
                  ' While nothing seems to be impossible with shfp builders, there are many
                  bold enough to prophesy that, so far
                  as slse is concerned, these steamers
                  . are the last word In the. building of
                  .merchant ships. They are being built
                  tor the. Oceanic Steam Navigation
                  company,' more widely known as the
                  White Star line.' and will ply between
                  Liverpool and New York. The new
                  Teasels will have a displacement of
                  .48.000 tons. They are to be 860 feet
                  long with a beam of 90 feet and the
                  boat deck will be more than 60 feet
                  above the water, fn both tonnage and
                  else they wilt 'surpass the Mauretanla
                  and Lusitanla, although they are not
                  expected to do In speed. The lines
                  of the new ships are not designed for
                  great speed, 21 knots being the average aimed at, as against the 25 of the
                  giant Cunarders. An immense amount
                  of space, which In fast boats is devoted to machinery, will thus be saved
                  for cabin accommodation. The carrying capacity of the Olympic and Titanic will exceed that of any ships
                  afloat today by at least one-thir- d.

                  Are Floating Hotels.
                  In almost every respect the new
                  ships will be floating hotels. Dane-in- g
                  rooms,, smoking rooms, .cafes, a
                  library and even gardens are to occupy prominent positions in these won
                  derful vessels. There will be a cool
                  avenue, of Oriental palms, beds of
                  rosea and carnations, and arbors skilfully contrived by expert gardeners.
                  In the winter months all these are to
                  be protected by glass roofs. '
                  Among
                  other interesting Innovations will be
                  a swimming bath, sufficiently deep
                  for diving and a skating rink.
                  The suites of cabins are to be In

                  Atlantic in almost the same privacy
                  aa In their own homes. There are to
                  be many dining' rooms, the principal
                  one of which will be elaborately dec

                  six hundred. Those Who wish to take
                  their meals on deck can do so at a

                  officers and men. The displacement of
                  each vessel when loaded will be nearly 60.000 tons. It is expected that
                  both ships will be ready to be placed
                  In regular service early next spring.

                  Harbor Improvements Abroad.
                  The "harbor board" of Soup tham p--
                  ton, Eng., recently decided to deepen
                  the channel of that port from 32 to 35
                  feet, to give sufficient water, for the
                  two great White Star liners, now
                  .building, the Titanic and Olympic. This
                  decision was conditional, however, on
                  the beneficiaries defraying a part of
                  the cost of the Improvement. The White Star line's share was-- fixed at
                  20,000 pounds, payable in ten annual
                  instalments of 2.000 pounds each, such
                  payments to be exclusive of ordinary
                  port dues, charges, etc The south
                  western railway, as owner or the docks,
                  is also to bear a part of the burden. thus proportionately assisting in reducing the public expenditures for tho completion of the project, which will
                  cost in all about $500,000 (100.000
                  pounds). Such contributions by interests and corporations . benefited, will
                  strike Americans accustomed to see
                  river and harbor improvements defray
                  ed entirely from taxation, as some
                  thing novel. The idea is old in oreat
                  Britain, where it appears to have
                  worked very well. Uncle Sam would appreciate its introduction in the United States even in a modified form.
                  If. for instance, the ambitious towns
                  Wbloh now secure $200,000 public build ings were chanted one-na- if the cost
                  of construction, and the rivers that
                  drain nothing but "the surrounding
                  treasury" were improved only on con
                  dition of local contribution in casn.
                  the federal finances would be all the
                  better and the nation none the worse
                  off. Boston Transcript.

                  Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," Missing
                  From Louvre Gallery.
                  Celebrated Painting Has Been
                  Mystery for Four Centuries

                  do da Vinci, the world famous paint
                  ing for whVch an offer of $5,000,000 is
                  said to have been refused and which
                  is reported to have been stolen from
                  the Louvre in Paris, for 400 years
                  has been as much a riddle as the
                  Sphinx itself. But one manSolomon
                  Reinach, brother of the Reinach of
                  notoriety in the Dreyfus affairever
                  has been so brazen as to proclaim
                  the solution of the smile that
                  wreathes the face of the woman in
                  the picture. His answer was laughed
                  to scorn by art critics. Others have
                  commented on the painting, but Rei
                  nach alone authoritatively announced
                  that the mystery was ended.
                  The "Mona Lisa" for four centuries
                  has stoou a monument to French art.
                  For four years1501 to 1504Da
                  Vinci, friend of Francesco del Gio
                  condo of Florence, spent his spare
                  moments at work on the painting.
                  The model was Mona Lisa Gherardini,
                  third wife of Giocondo. According to
                  Reinach, the lovelike expression on
                  the face of the model is far from in
                  dicating love.
                  Reinach asserts that Da Vinci paint
                  ed the portrait gratis for his friend,
                  when she was in deep grief, to divert
                  her mind. He surrounded her with
                  musicians, singers and buffoons to
                  keep her in gentle gayety. He worked
                  at the painting only when a certain
                  expression appeared on his model's
                  face, brought about by a peculiar
                  strain of music. He bore no love for
                  her, nor she for him.
                  Reinach even went so far as to ex
                  plain the deep melancholy of Mona
                  Lisa. He declared that she was mar
                  ried in 1495 and until 1499 had no
                  children. Then came a daughter. A
                  death record of Florence, by which it
                  appears that Fanciulia, little daugh
                  ter of Francesco del Giocondo and his
                  wife, Mona Lisa, was buried from the
                  Church of Santa Maria Novella on
                  June 1, 1501, is cited by him.
                  Whether Reinach's explanation is
                  .true or not, it was not received read-
                  Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa."
                  ily by the French. It was known that
                  Da Vinci had sold the painting to his
                  patron, Francis I. of France, for 4,000
                  gold ecus shortly after its completion.
                  The king kept it locked Jealously in
                  his gilded room at Fontainebleau,
                  and upon the death of Francis I.
                  Louis XIV. had it hung in his bed
                  chamber at Versailles. Following his
                  demise it was transferred to the Salon
                  Carre, where it since had attracted
                  world-wide attention.
                  "What is she smiling at?" ever has
                  been the unsolved riddle. To artists
                  Mona Lisa's smile became In turn ob
                  viously saucy, sportive, flirtatious and
                  even naughty, while plain people
                  called her the "jocund one."
                  Taine discovered in the smile that
                  Mona Lisa had been at least flirting
                  with Leonardo da Vinci, flattering him
                  and railing against her husband.
                  Michelet, the historian, said that he
                  used to go to the portrait "in spite of
                  himself, as the bird goes to the
                  snake." Theophlle Gautier discovered
                  that the subject of the painting was
                  flirting with the whole world, "this
                  strange creature whose look promises
                  unknown joys and whose expression is
                  divinely ironic." "She smiles with
                  mocking voluptuousness on the thou
                  sands who admire her," was the com
                  ment of Arsene Houssaye, manager of
                  the Theater Francais, who saw "shin
                  ing from that smile only the soul of
                  Leonardo in love."
                  Walter Patter revealed to the world
                  that It was an encyclopedia. "In this
                  beauty," he said, "the soul appears
                  with all its affections. All the thoughts
                  and experiences of the world hav
                  left their traces on itthe animalism
                  of Greece, the lubricity of Rome, the
                  revery of the middle ages, the return
                  of paganism, the sins of the Borgias!"
                  And supplementing this, the illus
                  trious Italian Carotti declared: "She
                  is the emanation of the intellectual,
                  sentimental and poetic power of her
                  time, with all the mystery of the
                  human soul and all its destiny."
                  In Europe the painting also is called
                  "La Joconde" and "Gioconda" and in
                  art circles it is considered to rank
                  second in value only to the Sistine
                  Madonna by Raphael. Both are price
                  less.

                  By JAMES A. EDCERTON.
                  THE disappearance of the fa
                  mous "Mona Idsa" of Leonardo
                  da Vlncl from the Louvre, nt
                  Paris, Is tho latest nine days'
                  Wonder In the 'world of art. This great
                  painting, also known as "La Glo-j
                  condo," has been pronounced by many ,
                  tho finest in the world. It certainly I
                  stands In a list of tho world's half'
                  dozen greatest paintings and in popu
                  lar regard perhaps ranks second onlyi
                  to tho "Slstlnc Madonna" by Ilaphacl.
                  Some think "Tho Last Supper," also I
                  by Da Vinci, greater than "Mona j
                  Lisa," but this sort of comparison is
                  fruitless, as tho two paintings are
                  qulto different In subject and treat
                  ment Walter Pater pronounced "La
                  Giocondo" as "in tho truest sense
                  Leonardo's masterpiece."
                  The painting is a portrait of Ma
                  donna Lisa del Giocondo, third wife
                  of Francesco del Giocondo of Flor
                  ence, both of whom would have been
                  forgotten centuries ago but for the
                  genius of Leonardo. It is said that
                  tho painter worked at this master
                  piece four years and then pronounced
                  it unfinished. To keep tho haunting
                  smile on tho subject's face he had
                  music and jesters in tho studio. As
                  wo now know it the painting has lost
                  somo of tho exquisite lines and hues
                  it had on leaving Da Vinci's band,
                  since It has faded through the cen
                  turies and has been retouched. Yet
                  even in this imperfect state it has
                  charmed the world.
                  Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452,
                  the natural son of a Florentine notary
                  and a peasant woman. He was cele
                  brated not only as a painter, but ns a
                  sculptor, architect, pngineer nnd scien
                  tist. He engaged in various engineer
                  ing and architectural works, divided
                  his timo between Milan, Venice and
                  .Florence nnd toward the end of his
                  life was attached to tho court of tho
                  king of France, where he died. Out
                  side of his many paintings ho did
                  much in sculpture, little of which sur
                  vives. Ho also accomplished mnny
                  works in the lino of engineering and
                  architecture, these being his chief vo
                  cations. In'sclence he was in advance
                  of his age, being especially versed in
                  anatomy. As an artist ho was a con
                  temporaryand in somo senses a com
                  petitorof Michelangelo and a teacher
                  of Ilaphacl, Fro Bartolommeo and oth
                  ers almost, as illustrious. His schools
                  at Milan, Florence and elsewhcro wero
                  tho beginning of n new era hi Italian
                  art. Ho was great not only as a pro
                  ducer, but as an lnspirer of others. By
                  many ho is regarded as tho most uni
                  versal genius of. tho renaissance period.
                  In person Leonardo was handsome,
                  with a fine face, great physical
                  strength nnd charm of manner. Among
                  his other accomplishments ho was a
                  musician. His "Mona Lisa" was paint
                  ed about 1505, when ho was more than
                  fifty years old. It was bought by tho
                  king of Franco and has since been tho
                  property of the French nation and in
                  more recent years tho pride and tho
                  greatest ornament of the Louvro,
                  where it has been admired by millions
                  from generation to generation.
                  Every one Is familiar with the paint
                  ing or with prints of it, Perhapa more
                  oopies, photographs, engravings nnd
                  other reproductions have been mado
                  of this than of any other painting' in
                  the world. Ono of tho proofs of its
                  quality is that tho artistic and popular
                  verdicts on it agree. Usually tho com
                  mon herd Is enraptured with things
                  that the art critics pronounce daubs,
                  and tho art critics aro enchanted with
                  somo impressionistic thing that is a
                  blank to tho man on tho street Dut
                  "Mona Lisa" is so supremely great
                  that it levels all ranks nnd compels
                  praiso from artist and layman alike.
                  The face, with its dowy eyes and
                  faint Bmlle, contains everything that
                  charms ua in womanhood. It is spir
                  itual, yet has touches of the "earth
                  earthy," alluring and still elevated and
                  sweet Tho charm Is one that oludes
                  analysis, as is the case with all that
                  is finest not only in painting, music
                  and poetry, but in nature. Tho effect
                  is wonderfully heightened by nn al
                  most weird background of rocks and
                  streams. This and the uphinxllko ex
                  pression of tho faco giva n 'mystical
                  element to tho picture that has per
                  haps proved its greatest charm. But
                  I am not enough of a highbrow in art
                  to trust myself to describe it and re
                  produce tho estimate of Walter Pater
                  In ono of tho finest pieces 6f writing
                  In English literature.
                  "Wo nil know," ho says, "tho face
                  and hands of tho figure, set in its mar
                  ble chair In that cirque, of fantastic
                  rocks, as in some faint light under
                  sea. Perhaps of all ancient pictures
                  timo has chilled it least"
                  Ho then goes on to descrlbo the
                  painting as n creation of tho artist's
                  train and soul rather than a por
                  trait of n flesh and blood person. Its
                  Infinite appeal is greater ' than could
                  have eomo from any physical likeness,
                  but rather arises from an indefinable
                  something not subject to decay, some
                  thing carrying a breath from the eter
                  nal country. To return to Pater;
                  The presence that thus roao so atraneety
                  bosldo the waters Is expressive ot what
                  In the ways of a thousand years men had
                  come to desire. Hera is the head upon

                  The loss of this picture Is regarded
                  by tho French ns a national calamity.
                  To them It is not only priceless, but
                  a part of their very life. It has been re
                  ported, and Is probably true, that the
                  French government once refused an
                  offer of $5,000,000 for tho painting.
                  tlon of tno act. That goes, paradox ana
                  all.
                  An interesting fact In this connection
                  is that several months ago it was re
                  ported In tho public prints that "Mona
                  Lisa" had been stolen and a copy sub
                  stituted in its place. This wns after
                  word denied, but tho disappearance
                  now makes it seem a strange coinci
                  dence, almost a prophecy.
                  There is one other possible explana
                  tion. It Is notorious that in Europe
                  the trade of making fake "old mas
                  ters" flourishes apace, chiefly for the
                  purpose of gulling American million
                  aires. These copies are properly aged
                  by processes that the fakers know and
                  nro then sold for fabulous prices to
                  those who have more money than ex
                  pert knowledge or perhaps real appre
                  ciation of "old masters." To do this
                  work fakers have to ppssess originals
                  in order that the copy may be as
                  nearly pcrfoct ns possible. Sometimes
                  these imitations aro so close that they
                  fool even the experts.
                  Somo sucli an organization of fakers
                  may have taken tho "Mona Lisa" for
                  copying purposes,, expecting afterward
                  to return tho origlnnl or a clover du
                  plicate for n ransom. This would bo
                  so hazardous a game, however, that
                  even a league of criminals would
                  hardly run the risk.
                  Mnny pictures havo been stolen in
                  tho past but nono even approaching
                  the value of, "Mona Lisa." Tho most
                  famous case in modern times was the
                  theft of Gainsborough's famous por
                  trait of the "Duchess of Devonshire."
                  The "electioneering duchess" sho was
                  called, having been nctivo in her hus
                  band's political canvasses. This paint
                  ing was missing nearly a quarter of a
                  century and was finally returned
                  through tho instrumentality of tho lato
                  Pnt Sheedy, tho "square" gamblor.
                  Sheedy's version of the affair was that
                  the thief was Adam Worth, whom
                  Sheedy regarded as the greatest crimi
                  nal of the last century. Tho painting
                  was originally Btolen to bo used in an
                  Masculine Dross Hotorm.

                  Upon its disappearance tho Louvro
                  was closed for several days, n large
                  force of police was sot to work search
                  ing every nook and cranny of tho
                  great building, and sixty detectives
                  were started working on tho outside.
                  Ono of the theories of tho authorities
                  was that tho thief was a young man
                  who wns known to hnve become enam
                  ored of tho painting nnd who had
                  visited it at intervals for several
                  months, sitting before it with a rapt
                  expression for hours together. They
                  believe that ho fell in lovo with the
                  face, ns painters have been known to
                  become enamored of their own works,
                  and grew lnsano upon the subject his
                  mania finally prompting tho crlmo.
                  So much wero people affected by this
                  masterpleoe that somo shed tears at
                  6ight of it Not a few letters havo
                  been received at the Louvro addressed
                  to "Mona Lisa" and expressing love
                  to her as to a living person.
                  That the deed was tho work of some
                  deranged person seems almost certain
                  for the reason that the plcturo could
                  not be disposed of - nnd boncq would bo
                  without value to the thief. A painting
                  is only valuable when shown. If tho
                  criminal could dlsposo of it to n pri
                  vate collector and t cannot 'bo con
                  ceived that any thief would dare to
                  offer it, fpr Bale or that any collector
                  would be bo foolish or depraved as to
                  buy it such collector would not dare
                  exhibit it for fear of detection. While
                  there are many copies of tho painting
                  that tho average man could hardly de
                  tect from tho original, thero aro al
                  ways those who can distinguish, and
                  now that the wholo world is on the
                  lookout for tho picture every copy will
                  bo subjected to closer inspection.

                  true constitute its chiof value to the
                  collector; hence insanity of ono form
                  or another Is the only rational explana-
                  effort toget one of Worth's accom
                  plices out of Jail. Tho mna escaped
                  on n technicality, however, and Worth
                  had tho plcturo on his bands. He did
                  not dare to sell It or even to mention
                  Its. existence. The painting was kept
                  in a hermetically scaled caso in the
                  false bottom of a trunk. The Pinker
                  tons, who were set to work on tho
                  case, believed that Worth was tho
                  thief, but could not prove it
                  This is where Sheedy came into tho
                  case. Worth had at one time done
                  Sheedy a kindness $2,000 worth of
                  kindness, to bo exact Pinkerton heard
                  of this and asked Sheedy that if ho
                  ever saw Worth again to find out about
                  tho Gainsborough. Som years later,
                  when Sheedy was running a gambling
                  Joint in Constantinople, ho received
                  word from Adam Worth, who was in
                  trouble, as usual. Sheedy, of course,
                  more than' mado good tho former loan
                  and got Worth out Ho then men
                  tioned the matter of the Gainsborough,
                  and Worth replied that ho was on tho
                  point of breaking tho ico on that sub
                  ject himself. Tho upshot of it all wns
                  that Sheedy acted as a .go-between,
                  got the picture out of tho false bottom
                  of' tho trunk where it was in storage
                  in Boston, bad the British owners over
                  to examine it, collected tho $25,000 re
                  ward, presumably turned over tho
                  money to Adam Worth nnd hla pals
                  and as a result of the incident got into
                  "art" himself.
                  Worth was so- grateful for Sheedy's
                  action in tho Gainsborough affair
                  that beforo his death bo insisted on
                  giving Pat an original Murillo which
                  had been stolen out of some monastery.
                  When this came into his hands Sheedy
                  tried to find tho rightful owners, ad
                  vertising extensively in South America
                  nnd elsewhere, but failed. Some years

                  The story of "Mona Lisa" has been der to
                  recalled to the minds of the art lov-, smile.

                  a wonderful reproduction by the Uni
                  versity of Missouri. "It is the finest
                  ever made," said Dr. John Pickard
                  when it was first shown. "If it could
                  be hung by the side of the original,
                  critics could scarcely tell which was
                  the original and which the reproduc
                  tion." The artist, Leonardo da Vinci, was
                  one of the greatest masters of the
                  High Renaissance and he was also
                  celebrated as sculptor, architect, en
                  gineer and scientist. He was born
                  at Vinci, a mountain town in France
                  in 1432, the illegitimate son of Ser
                  Piero da Vinci, a Florentine notary,
                  and Catanna, peasant woman. His
                  boyhood days were spent under the
                  care of his paternal grandparents at
                  Vinci. Afterwards, he lived in Flor
                  ence with his father and was treated
                  as a legitimate son on the same foot
                  ing with Ser Pier's younger children.
                  He received the best education Flor
                  ence could afford. Personally he was
                  singularly handsome and powerful
                  in physique, possessing both social
                  and intellectual charm.
                  Leonardo visited in Milan in 1482
                  and remained there until 1499
                  the service of Lodovico il Moro.
  
                  was here that he painted his master
                  piece, the "Last Supper," a wall dec
                  oration in the Monastery of Santa
                  Maria delle Grazie, Milan. Owing
                  ch'efly to his use of oil colors' di
                  rectly on the wall, to neglect and to
                  the vandalism of monks and soldiers,
                  only a ruin of the grand original re
                  mains. He painted other pictures
                  during his stay in Milan but most of
                  them have been lost.
                  It was several years later, after he
                  returned to Florence that he paint
                  ed the portrait of "Mona Lisa," per
                  haps the moft celebrated portrait in
                  the world. She was the third wife
                  of the Florentine, Francesco del
                  Giocondo, whence the name "La
                  loconde" by which the picture is
                  known in France. Rumors of
                  Leonardo's infatuation for this
                  beautiful woman have never been
                  verified but several other sketches
                  and another painting were found of
                  which she evidently was the model.
                  He spent intervals of four years
                  painting "Mona Lisa." The sittings
                  were short because he
                  only when Mono smiled. The artist
                  is said to have employed musicians
                  and jesters to perform nearby in order
                  produce the "inscrutable
                  smile"
  
                  The "Mona Lisa" which hung for
                  five years in the Sajon Carre of the
                  Louvre in Paris, had suffered from I
                  the hands of the restorer; the red
                  ness of the lips and face had disap
                  peared, although the subtle smile and
                  wonderful hands were almost un
                  spoiled.
                  The British Government once of
                  fered 5 million dollars for the paint
                  ing, but it was not to be purchased.
                  The stories about the subject of the
                  portrait and the unending discus
                  sions as to the character shown
                  by the face and the meaning of the
                  smile have, apart from the painting's
                  undoubted value as a work of art.
                  made it a subject of universal interest.
                  On August 21, 1911, the picture
                  was missed from its place in the
                  Louvre. The guard thought the offi
                  cial photographer had taken it to
                  his studio to copy it. as he often did.
                  It was not until late Tuesday even
                  ing that the guard announced the
                  picture had been stolen. After a
                  hasty search, the heavy frame was
                  found under a stairway leading to
                  one of the cloakrooms. A scaffold
                  against the facade of the Louvre
                  in i placed there in connection with the
                  It installation of an elevator, made it
                  easy to enter or leave the building.
                  A person acquainted with the inter
                  ior and provided with keys to the
                  various rooms could easily reach the
                  Salon Carre where the picture hung.
                  Some say the portrait was stolen
                  as an object lesson, to show how
                  careless the keepers of the Louvre
                  were and how easily pictures could
                  be stolen. Others think perhaps an
                  artist has stolen it and will return a
                  reproduction and keep the original,
                  or that a big reward will be demand
                  ed and at its payment the picture will
                  be returned in an indirect way after
                  the excitement has died down.
                  More romantic than any of these
                  conjectures is that "Mona, Lisa" is
                  another Helen of Troy. Some one
                  has fallen in love with her and in
                  desperation carried her off to his se
                  cret altar where he can worship her
                  away from the stare of the crowds
                  and jealously guard her from the
                  eyes of other worshipers.
                  Wherever "Mona Lisa" is hidden,
                  she is carefully guarded, for no trace
                  could paint' s en rouna! and Paris, as well as
                  inousanus or signtseers who nave
                  gazed upon her beauty, are still
                  wondering and talking of her disap
                  pearance.

                  usual precautions to save Leonardo
                  da Vinci's sister masterpiece from a
                  similar fate.
                  This painting, equally esteemed
                  by art connoisseurs, but oversha
                  dowed for the mass of visitors by
                  the enormous fame of "Mona Lisa"
                  or "La Joconde," as the French
                  call it, because of its haunting
                  smile is an idealized portrait of
                  Lucrezia Crevelll, the beautiful
                  young Lombard poetess who in
                  spired Lombardo's brush during the
                  earlier period of his fame.
                  Owing to the jewelled band which
                  encircles the brow, the picture is
                  called "La Belle Ferronniere." In
                  this case Leonardo performed mar
                  vels with a pair of wonderful eyes,
                  which are hardly less compelling in
                  their influence than the elusive
                  smile of "Mona Lisa."
                  Paris devotees at the shrine of
                  the great Lombardo have always
                  divided their acts of devotion pretty
                  equally between "Mona Lisa" and
                  "La Belle Ferronniere." standing
                  before them for hours in evident
                  rapture over that smile and those
                  eyes, and then going home and
                  writing love letters to them.
                  These love letters to portraits of
                  Italian beauties three hundred years
                  in their graves are always opened
                  and read by the Louvre authorities.
                  To the writer of some such letters
                  they attribute the theft of "Mona
                  Lisa." Since ths disappearance of
                  that masterpiece the devotional
                  visits and letters to "La Belle Fer
                  ronniere" have doubled in numbers,
                  and the actions of some of the vis
                  itors and letter writers have been
                  so fanatical that the painting has
                  been placed under a competent
                  guard night and day. It Is also
                  guarded against a too close ap-'
                  proach by any but Its official cus
                  todians. When Leonardo da Vincii painted
                  Lncrezia he was still a "primitive.'
                  He had not yet discovered the ef
                  fect of light and atmosphere When
                  he painted the poetess he was a

                  better known sister. It Is more
                  subtle, more diffilcult to understand,

                  Leonardo. He produced but one

                  after further examination today.
                  The picture bears the seals of the
                  Louvre and other galleries in which it
                  has been hung; while the traces of re
                  pairs at the back of the canvas also
                  are visible. The prisoner was again
                  interrogated by the police authorities
                  this morning. He repeated his story
                  of having stolen the picture as an act
                  of patriotic vengeance for Napoleon's
                  depredations in Italy. He displayed
                  the utmost indignation at his treatment
                  by the police, declaring it unjust after
                  the risks he had run and the abnega
                  tion he had demonstrated out of pa
                  triotic sentiment.
                  A number of prominent Italians have
                  w ritten to the Italian minister of pub
                  lic instruction requesting him to per
                  mit "'Mona Lisa" to be placed on exhi
                  bition in Florence, its former home,
                  before returning it to the French gov
                  ernment.
                  Some weeks ago an Italian wrote to
                  Signor Geri. an antiquary of Florence,
                  saying: "I am in possession of the miss
                  ing 'Mona Lisa," but being a patriotic
                  Italian I desire that it shall remain in
                  Florence, the center of Ita'ian art."
                  He signed the letter "Leonard," and
                  the antiquary at first paid small atten
                  tion to it. thinking he had to do with a
                  madman. Later, however, he communi
                  cated with Dr. Poggi, director of the
                  Florentine museums, who suggested that
                  he continue the correspondence with the
                  man. This was done, and an appoint
                  ment was arranged whereby Geri was to
                  view the picture at Milan. The date set J

                  ed Geri Thursday. He said he was
                  "Leonard" and was staying at the Hotel
                  Tripoli. He asked Geri to go with him
                  to see the picture. The dealer notified
                  Dr. Poggi. who hastened to the hotel,
                  and on being shown the painting recog
                  ii'zed it as the genuine "Mona Lisa."
                  Dr. Poggi asked to be allowed to take
                  the picture with him. so that he might
                  ompare it with other works. He made
                  an appointment to meet "Leonard" yes
                  terday afternoon at the hotel, to agree
                  ?ipoi the price. The director took with
                  him several officers, who placed the man
                  nnder arrest.
                  ? On being interrogated the prisoner said
                  hi.- real name is Vincenzo Perugia, that
                  he was born in the province of Como,
                  Is b> profession a decorator, and is un
                  married. For six years he lived in
                  France, and for three years was em
                  ployed at the Louvre.
                  Perugia posed .?s a patriot. "I was
                  ashamed." lie said, "that for more than
                  a century no Italian had thought of

                  Frenchmen under Napoieon, when they

                  of all kinds by wagonloads. ancient
                  manuscripts by thousands, and gold by

                  Storen Early in Morning'.
                  He had often observed, he said, in the
                  Louvre many works of art stolen from
                  Italy, and conceived the idea of return
                  ing to its true home Leonardo da Vinci's
                  masterpiece. He entered the Louvre

                  At the time of the theft Perugia was
                  not employed in the Louvre, but he knew
                  all the exits and entrances, and how to
                  avoid attention. He kept the painting
                  concealed, he said, until his patriotism
                  leti him to offer it to the Italian people.

                  worked on the picture for four years,

                  "I am In possession of tho missing
                  'Mona Lisa.' but being a patriotic Italian,
                  I dcalro that It shall remain in Flor
                  ence, the center of Italian art."
                  He signed the letter "Leonard," and
                  the antiquary at first paid small atten
                  tion to It, thinking he had to do with a
                  madman. Later, however, he communi
                  cated with Dr. Poggl, director of the
                  Florentine museums, who suggested that
                  ho continue the correspondence with the
                  man. This was done and an appoint
                  ment was arranged whereby Gerl was
                  to view the picture at Milan. The dato
                  set was Novembor 17. but unforeseen
                  circumstances prevented the meotlng. A
                  young man. fairly well dressed, visited
                  Gerl yesterday. Ho said ho waa "Leon
                  ard" and was staying at the Hotel Trip
                  oli. He asked Gerl to go with him to
                  see the picture. The dealer notified Dr.
                  Poggl, who hastened to the hotel and
                  on being shown tho painting recognized
                  It as tho genuine "Mona Lisa."
                  Dr Poggl asked to be allowed to take
                  the picture with him so that ho might
                  compare It with other worke. He mado
                  an appointment to meet "Leonard" this
                  afternoon at tho hotel to agree upon tho
                  price. The director took with him sev

                  his real namo was Vlncenzo Perugia;
                  that he was, bom In the province of
                  Como, whs by profession a decorator and

                  France and for throe years waa employed
                  nt the Louvre.
                  Perugia posed as a patriot. T was
                  ashamed," he said, "that for more than
                  a century no Italian had thought of
                  avenging tho spoliation committed by
                  Frenchmen under Napoleon, when they
                  carried off from the Italian museums and

                  To thin Senor Credaro replied:
                  "I do not caro for your head, but If
                  this news, after It Is published is found

                  Tho deputies surrounded tflo minister of

                  Somo of them remarked that Napoleon's
                  docds were too antiquated to constitute
                  grounds for feuds. If it were not so
                  Italy would quarrel with the w1hole
                  world, ns all countries, Including the
                  United States, had stolon masterpieces
                  from her. Tho famous "Ascoll Cope,"

                  Slgnor Credaro announced that Italy
                  would apply tho same generosity. Ho
                  said he had Immediately notified the
                  French embassador, Camllle Barrere. of
                  tho discovery of tho painting. He added
                  " 'Mona Lisa' will be delivered to tho
                  embassador with a solemnity worthy
                  of Leonardo da Vlncl and a spirit of hap
                  plnesB worthy of 'Mona Lisa's' smile.

                  Italians as one of the best productions
                  of tho genius of their race, we will will
                  ingly return it to its foster country,
                  which has regretted Its loss so bitterly,
                  an a fresh pledge of friendship and
                  brotherhood between the two great Latin

                  state of preservation, notwithstanding
                  the vicissitudes It must have undergone.
                  Perugia, although he has not made a
                  comploto confession, has admitted that
                  ho concealed it under the false bottom

                  given 'to avenge thefts committed In
                  Italy by Napoleon' dearly shows this.

                  Beroud in the Salon, Showing the Spot from Which the "Mona Lisa" Was Stolen.
                  Paris, February 8.
                  T1IH French Oovornmont is do
                  tcrmlnod that "Mona Lisa"
                  shall not bo stolon again.
                  Extraordinary precautions havo
                  low been taken to provent this or
                  ny othor of tho treasures of tho
                  Louvre from being taken away.
                  Ono of tho first stops takea to
                  iafeguard tho Louvro was to employ
                  1 number of dogs of tho clovor breed
                  mown as police dogs. Ono ot them
                  ruards ovory fifty feet of wall Bpace
                  lay and night. No man can now put
                  i hand over the rolling In front of
                  tho pictures without having a dog
                  ifter him.
                  Tho next protective meaBuro was
                  to connect tho pictures by a rod so
                  that all tlioso along a certain wall
                  space can bo locked up from ono
                  lock. Formorly ovory picture hung
                  separately.
                  Undor tho now arrangemont each
                  line of pictures hangs upon ono flat
                  rod by hooks In tho frame, -which
                  only admit tho rod when It is turned
                  edgewise to tho opening In tho hook.
                  Then tho rod Is turned so that the
                  picture cannot be removod from It,
                  and Is locked In that -position.
                  Llttlo chambers havo also boon
                  constructed behind the carved mold
                  Ings near the celling, from which
                  tho guardians of tho Louvro can so
                  crotly watch every person in tho
                  rooms. Tho knowlodgo that n hid
                  den guardian Is watching them Is
                  expected to havo a terrifying effect
                  on would-be thieves.
                  Tho plcturos havo also been con
                  nected by electric wiring. Any tam
                  pering with them closes a circuit
                  and causeis an electric boll to ring
                  loudly.
                  Tho return of "Mona Lisa" has only
                  omphaslzed tho necessity ot guard
                  ing against similar occurrences In
                  future. Tho confession ot Vincenzo
                  Perugia lias revealed tho astonish
                  ing caso with which ho was ablo to
                  2. Perugia Removes the Painting
                  from Its Heavy Frame.
                  walk away with what Is probably
                  tho most valuable art treasure in
                  tho world.
                  It was on tho morning of August
                  22, 1911, that tho world was startled
                  by the announcement that Leonardo
                  da Vinci's great masterpiece had
                  been stolen. IU disappearance from
                  its accustomed place in tho Salon
                  Carre, or Square Salon, was noted on
                  August 21. To some reporters who
                  inquired Intelligently about its dis
                  appearance tho officials on that day
                  explained that It had been taken dovri,
                  to bo cleaned. On tho following day
                  the government decided that It was
                  useless to attempt to conceal any
                  longer tho fact that It bad been
                  stolon. Its value was estimated at
                  $5,000,000.
                  It is Interesting to recall somo of
                  tho extraordinary speculations and
                  theories that were advanced con
                  cerning Its disappearance. Somo
                  argued that It was incredible that
                  a government possession of such In
                  calculable value could bo taken by
                  a common thief. Thoy said that
                  somo person ot great Influence, a
                  Cabinet Minister or other high offi
                  cial, had taken tho picture to photo
                  graph It, had damaged It accidentally
                  and was keeping It until ho could
                  repair It.
                  Another theory was that tho mys
                  terious psychological and sex influ
                  ence of tho picture would prove to
                  bo tho clue to Its disappearance
                  It Is woll known that this exquisite
                  and subtly fascinating portrait of
                  Mona Lisa del Glcondo exerts n
                  very diverse Influence upon the two
                  eoxes. Men of Impressionable tern
                  peramont are strongly drawn toward
                  it and feel a deep and oven passion
                  ate pleasure in tho radiations of Its
                  "onigmatlcal smile." Women, on the
                  other hand, are, with equal frequency,
                  repolled by It, and are oven stirred
                  to hato and fury by the same smile.
                  The partisans of this theory fell
                  Into two groups. Ono group said
                  that a man mentally disordered by
                  the Btrango fascination of tho plo
                  turo must have stolon it to enjoy Its
                  subtlo charms In secret. Tho other
                  group -argued that a wothan had
                  taken it to vent .the rage of her
                  sex upon It.
                  Ono thing becamo clear from the
                  mass of theories and Interesting facts
                  brought out by tho eplsodo. Tho
                  contents of the Louvro were not, and
                  novor had boen, well safeguarded.
                  Plcturos worth from $1,000,000 to
                  $5,000,000 could havo been pulled off
                  their hooks at a favorable moment
                  any day without detection.
                  Officials, moreover, had boen In
                  the habit, of lending the art treasures
                  to artists and persons of Influence.
                  It was stated that 250 pictures had
                  boen stolen or borrowed" In tho
                  course of tho nineteenth century.

                  the Frame In.
                  tho rocovery of tho great" picture
                  came to be regarded as hopeless.
                  Then, on December 12, 1913, came
                  tho news that It hud been found.
                  An art dealer Informed the director
                  of the Ufflzl flsllery nt Florence that
                  an Italian workman named Vincenzo
                  Porugln had taken the picture and
                  had It In Florence. This statement
                  was, verified and the "-Mona Lisa"
                  returned to France.
                  The confession of Perugia shows
                  that tho Bubtle psychological Influ
                  ence of this picture had, Indeed,
                  imudh to do with his act.
                  Perugia said:
                  "I am a patriotic Italian. I saw
                  that tho Louvro was filled with mas
                  terpieces stolen by Napoleon from
                  Italy. I longed to take something
                  back.
                  "I thought of taking n Ra panel, a
                  Titian a Corregglo and several other
                  (masterpieces.. But the Mona Lisa
                  seemed to me much more appealing.
                  "Hero sho Is. I give her back, to
                  my country. It Is tho greatest sacrl
                  flco of my life."
                  From Perugia's confession It ap
                  peared that he had worked as u paint
                  er for a decorating contractor of 280
                  Rue St. Honore, Paris. He had
                  worked as a painter on tho Louvro
                  for some weeks, but gave up this
                  worK on January 24,
                  1911. Between this
                  date and August 21
                  he meditated upon
                  and carried out' his
                  plan for stealing the
                  Mona Lisa.
                  It was 7 o'clock in
                  tho morning of Au
                  gust -l when he en
                  tared the Louvre.
                  The building was
                  opon then for tho
                  workmen and guard
                  ians or care-takers,
                  but tho general pub
                  lic was not admitted
                  that day.
                  Perugia wore tho

                  working on the

                  and took It from the
                  hooks by which it
                  was hung. A man
                  standing on the floor
                  could reach his hand
                  to tho top ot tho
                  small picture.

                  the Head of a Stairway.
                  Then he realized that the frame
                  would be heavy and hard to conceal.
                  Mo quickly removed the picture
                  from the frame. H left tho picture
                  lying in the salon and carried tho
                  frame to a doorway a few yards
                  away at. the head of small stair
                  way and left It outside the doorl
                  Then ho roturned, Tor tho picture.
                  He thrust it under his looso blouse,
                  whero It was scarcely noticeable.
                  Hearing footsteps, he decided to
                  leave hurriedly by the small stair
                  way where he had left the frame.
                  As he went out he put tho key in his
                  pocket to prevent any one pursuing
                  him that way.
                  Having rqach'ed, the e?ound. ho
                  crossed tho Courtyard of tho Sphinx,

                  which faces on the Seine.

                  THE RESTORED MONA LISA
                  By Frederic J. Haskin.

                  an outraged England arid made all art
                  lovers weep by hacking the incomparable
                  Rokeby Venus. She did it to get the
                  vote. It recalls the most famous of all
                  art thefts?the stealing of the Mona Lisa
                  by an Italian to avenge the depreda ions
                  of Napoleon a century old. The complete
                  story of that famous mystery only
                  new may be told with authority.
                  Smiling the same inscrutable smile
                  which the master genius, Leonardo da
                  Vinci, imprisoned upon canvas 400 years
                  ago to the vexation of generations of interpreters,
                  Mona Lisa, mysterious portrait,,
                  restored to her admirers after
                  strangely vanishing under the eyes of h :r
                  guards and eluding the frantic search of
                  a nation of art lovers again looks down
                  from her place in the Louvre, Paris, the
                  interest of her subtle, mystic expression
                  enhanced by reason of her peculiar adventure.
                  Mona Lisa, or, as the Italians call her.
                  La G.aconda on account of the haunting
                  challenge which the artist divined in the
                  face of his sitter and which he wove into
                  the fabric of his colors, has enthralled
                  and fascinated beholders from the beginning.
                  Many explanatory pages have
                  been written on the meaning of this
                  famous painting, and. provoked by its
                  indefinable charm, its elusive suggestion,
                  many an art student has brought the
                  full power of his critical acumen to tne
                  task of finding suitab.e words for the
                  description or th3 picture's strange appeal.
                  Each attempt has failed and ea.h
                  writer has dwelt with peculiar emphas.s
                  upon the qualities of the Mona Lisan

                  This masterpiece is one of the most
                  treasured of the Louvre collection. It

                  was begun by da Vinci about 1503,
                  when the master stood at the zenith of
                  his fame and power, and, accoiding to
                  v asari, it took four years of intermiton
                  t labor to complete. The woman in
                  hose likeness there was, or into which
                  .he artist wrought an intangible something.

                  narried in 1495 to Francesco di Bardemeo
                  di Zanobi del Giocondo, a
                  rominent citizen of Florence. When
                  she began her sittings for what has
                  since become one of the most renowned
                  of all the world's portraits she was

                  and mystic:, was fifty-one. Was
                  it an unusual woman that the ripened
                  master painted or was it a forceful
                  symbol coined by his rich, discerning
                  miml? Many times this quest-on has
                  :-cc-n put to. the lady of the superior
                  smile, answered only by the tantalizing
                  glance through the thick, protecting
                  varnish.
                  No wonder, when the loss of their
                  treasure was discovered on the morning
                  of August 21, 1911, a Monday, all Paris
                  was wrbught to a frenzy. The news of
                  the theft was received in all parts f
                  the civilized world with the same feelnes
                  of dismay. The picture missing
                  i'rom its place in the Sa'on Carre was
                  the most beautiful from Leonardo's
                  brush, and one of the most precious
                  creations of western culture.

                  Two years and four months passed by
                  without a trace of the vanished work.

                  Without a Clue. High rewards of,
                  fered for the return of the painting went
                  unclaimed, and every clue as to the
                  whereabouts of the thief ended just tl
                  j without the Louvre gates. As the months n
                  spied by while the endeavors of the police
                  proved vain and not even rumors came
                  of a Mona Lisa in foreign lands, all hope
                  that the picture would ever be recovered
                  was given up. It was concluded that _
                  the work had been destroyed. The fate *
                  of Mona Lisa was put to the account of
                  one of those unintelligible acts of vandalism
                  which go to swell the records of hu- ^
                  man pathology.
                  Boundless was the enthusiasm, then, K
                  which greeted the sudden, unexpected re- L
                  appearance of the Gioconda Thursday, ^
                  December 11, 1913, at Florence. In Flor- g
                  ence the original Mona Lisa had sat for
                  a portrait by one of the greatest painters w
                  of all times, and in a dingy inn at Florence
                  the lost painting was found again. C
                  The Italian authorities obtained imme- p;
                  diate possession of the picture, which h
                  was taken in triumphal procession a:
                  through Italy, under police guard to
                  Rome, to the French ambassador Bar- tl
                  rere. and, then, to Milan, where the di- w
                  rector general of the Louvre, Henry Mar- H
                  eel, and the director of paintings, Jd. Leprieur.
                  came to take charge if it. The b
                  Mona Lisa was again safely housed in in
                  Paris last New Year day, and was again
                  hung in its accustomed place at the n,
                  Louvre, which place had been filled dur- ee
                  ing the time of its loss by Raphael's p
                  Castiglione. L
                  The theft of this irreplaceable work tr
                  was an extraordinary one, in that the ol
                  criminal had been able to penetrate one to
                  of the best guarded treasure houses of E
                  f Europe and make away with one of its te
                  j most prized and precious possessions, and tr

                  The glass casing and the frame of the r
                  picture were found leaning against the 17
                  wall of a narrow stairway leading from n
                  the galiery des sept metres, where the le
                  old Italian pictures are hung, to the a
                  Court of the Sphinx. The door opening S)
                  from the stairway part of glass protect- n
                  ed by iron work, was locked, and, at the
                  investigation, Sauvet, one of the working- f,
                  men in the Louvre, remembered having ^
                  opened the door at the request of a per- il
                  son upon whom he came sitting at the 51
                  bottom of the stairway. He failed to
                  take further notice of this person, other
                  ! than that he was wearing a blouse simi;
                  !ar to those worn by the regular guards. c

                  j of a left thumb upon the abandoned
                  glass frame was all that remained in the 
                  Notwithstanding full reports of the matj
                  ter in L'Illustration, and other papers,
                  ? nothing more of the criminal was learned
                  j L'lllustration immediately announced |
                  I that it would pay 40,000 francs, about
                  J $8,000, to any one who would return the !
                  ! picture by September 26, and 45,000 francs
                  I ?or $9,000?if the picture was brought to
                  ! them by September 1. It was further announced
                  that no questions would be
                  asked. The editors received some five
                  hundred letters in answer to their announcements,
                  investigated some one hundred
                  cases, and learned nothing. The
                  Museum Club (Amis du Louvre) gave the
                  police 25,000 francs to be used for the obtaining
                  of the painting.
                  The court of investigation convened August
                  22, and in its hearings the photographed
                  thumb print played a leading
                  role. No less than 257 persons were ordered
                  by the court to submit their thumb
                  prints for comparison. Among those furnishing
                  such prints were the directors of

                  Only once was the suspicion of the po- B

                  with the work of framing some f
                  ' the most costly masterpieces. In Oc- t
                  >ber, 1911, Prof. Pierre Marcel of the t
                  cole des Beaux-Arts wrote an open let- a
                  r to the paper Figaro suggesting that t
                  ace of the criminal was to be sought a
                  nong the Louvre glaziers. The director f
                  ' painting took the suggestion, obtained
                  ie names of those so employed and for- e
                  erly so employed, upon which list ap- f
                  3ared the name of Peruggia, who, with g
                  te rest, was subject to an examination
                  id a house search. The mystery is that c

                  Mona Lisa" Thief on Trial.
                  Florence. Italy, June 4. The trial
                  of Vincenzo Perugia, on the charge
                  of stealing Da Vinci's masterpiece,
                  "Mona Lisa" from the Douvre in Par
                  is, began here today.
                  The disappearance of the picture
                  on August 22, ll'll, caused a sensa
                  tion throughout the world, and search
                  for it was not successful until Decem
                  ber 12, lf'13, when Perugia offered it
                  for sale to a Florentine antiquarian.
                  D. It. Analili. an alienist, said at
                  todays' hearing that Perugia was only
                  partially responsible for his actions.
                  Perugia did not deny that he had
                  taken "Mona Lisa" from the Louvre.
                  He said it was his desire to have
                  i placed in the Palazza Delig Vffizi
                  in Florence. Ti stimony as to the
                  authenticity of the picture was given
                  by st-vral experts. Other witnesses
                  gave evidence as to the details of the

                  The Mona Lisa Thief.
                  In view of the stir caused by
                  his crime, Vincen^o Perugia, who stole
                  "Mona Lisa" from the Louvre galleries
                  in Paris, gets a very light sentence. The
                  court decrees that he be imprisoned for
                  a year and fifteen days, of which period
                  he has already served nearly six months
                  while awaiting trial, so that in about half
                  a year from now he will have completed his
                  penalty for r.n act which caused more stir
                  in the world than the looting of a bank.
                  Indeed, mere bank robbing is so common
                  that Perugia's crime stands out as a
                  star performance. This possibly emotional.
                  possibly commercial theft appeared
                  for a time to be beyond solution, and
                  probably If Perugia had not undertaken
                  to sell his loot In Florence the mystery
                  wouid have remained unsolved. Certainly !
                  the temporary separation of "Mona Lisa" '
                  from her place in the Louvre added, if 1
                  possible, to her value as a work of art.

                  always on duty below her to make sure t

                  the wall. Of course, there are those
                  who declare that the smile of Gioconda
                  has more meaning now than ever, since j

                  several -vain attempt to sain favor
                  with the reigning pope. When, there
                  fore, king Frances I came to Florence
                  in search of art treasures, he was
                  flattered and delighted when the
                  greatest painter of the day called to
                  seek his patronage. The king did not
                  only profoundly admire his talents,
                  but he was nersonally very fond of
                  him. Leonardo being a splendid me
                  chanician, delighted the king with in
                  genious toys which he loved to pro
                  vide for bis entertainment. Once he
                  constructed an automaton lion, which
                  walked into the king's presence, open
                  ing Its breast and disclosing bouquets
                  of lilies. He returned with king
                  Frances to France where he spent his
                  remaining years painting. For La
                  Gioconda" the king paid about 9000.
                  He had It placed In the Cabinet Dore
                  in Fontalnebleau, from where in later
                  years Louis XI v had It moved to the
                  palace at Versailles.

                  Lisa's captivating smile. At his
                  special command the picture was
                  moved to his private apartments in
                  the Tuileries. After his downfall It
                  was moved to the gallery of the
                  Louvre, but during the Franco-German
                  war In 1S70 it was sent to Brest
                  for safe keep until 1871 when it was
                  returned to the Louvre and placed in
                  Salon Carre. There Is something in
                  the woman's bearing that has led men
                  of all ages and all classes to worship
                  at her feet. Sympathy Is woman's
                  greatest attribute and it is this gift
                  that de Vinci has given the Mona
                  Lisa. Her attitude Is not Introspect
                  ive, as though she were sending out
                  sympathy to all who gaze on her.
                  The Mona Lisa of the Louvre has a
                  much talked of rival in the Mona Lisa
                  of the Frado in Madrid. Francis I of
                  France and Charles X of Spain were
                  rivals for the crown of the Holy
                  Roman empire. But king Francis had
                  the advantage of ravaging Italy alx
                  years before Charles X, As a rival art
                  collector Charles then tried to our-
                  chase a Mona Lisa as beautiful as that
                  in France. He procured one that Is
                  very similar to the Louvre picture,
                  but nat as beautiful. For many years
                  It was contended that the one In the
                  Prado was the original and that king!
                  Charles had purchased it from de
                  Vinci's heirs. In an old catalogue of
                  the Spanish art gallery, the Mona Lisa ;
                  is listed as a cony of the Louvre. I
                  Either it is a cony or Leonardo made
                  two pictures, but gradually the one 
                  in tne raao oroppea into oo scanty
                  and thes one in the Louvre became
                  known as the most marvelous and

                  The Mona Lisa is more famous to
                  dav than it has ever been and has
                  been rendered still more famous by

                  most colossal theft of modern times.
                  and its disappearance was a startling
                  event in the art world. Mark Twain
                  once pointed a moral for all such
                  thieves as the one who stole the Mona
                  Lisa from the Louvre. He showed how
                  easy it was to steal a white elephant,
                  but how hard It became to get rid of
                  It afterwards. The French authori
                  ties were baffled.
                  Private donors offered large sums
                  of money for a ransom, "no questions
                  asked," to the thief so kind as to re
                  turn France's most precious heirloom.
                  Many theories sprang up as to the
                  motive of the thief. Some said an
                  ardent American stole it to have 
                  copy made and would then return It.
                  Others said It was hoax trumped up to
                  show how easily the Louvre could be
                  robbed. A French novelist then ad
                  vanced the theory that it had been
                  stolen by  blue eyed dreamer who
                  had fallen mystically In love with
                  Mona Lisa. An American Journal com
                  mented that If the police were not
                  careful, someone would, steal the
                  Louvre itself. For two years private
                  detectives searched the world for the
                  missing treasure. And then one day
                  the thief came out frim his hiding
                  place.
                  Theft of the Picture.
                  . One morning while the guards were
                  making rounds in the Louvre, Vln

                  doing some necessary repair work, ap
                  parently. As the guard rounded the
                  corner, Vlncenzo seized a sharp knife
                  and ripped the Mona Lisa out of her
                  frame. Just then the guard returned, j

                  hurriedly placing the picture face
                  down in his tool box, and to all ap
                  pearances was selecting a tool to con
                  tinue work. The guard passed on.
                  Three days later, on August 22, the
                  theft was discovered. Vlncenzo was
                  never suspected. That -evening he had j
                  simply slipped the picture in his
                  blouse and walked off. He left the
                  employ of the Louvre, and placing his
                  booty again In the tool box. he carried
                  it through to Italy without its belnsr '

                  trying to sell It in Florence. He ex- 1
                  plained his act by saying he wished
                  to revenge Italy against the ravages
                  of Napoleon L Why he chose the
                  Mona Lisa which legitimately belongs ,
                  to France, no one knows
                  Its Dlaeovery. I
                  The news of its discovery created!
                  great excitement in Florence. When
                  It was carried through the streets In a 1
                  grand procession o the Dffizi gal-1
                  lery, the crowds bared their heads as '
                  the picture passed. Thirty thousand
                  people came to see It in the Uf f UL ;
                  while the throngs outside fought to
                  set In. pushing through strontr lines '
                  and smashing doors. The French gov
                  ernment consented to allow the pic
                  ture to be exhibited In Rome before
                  its return.
                  Mona Lisa was the rage. Women In
                  Italy tried to imitate her smile and
                  employed cosmetics to reproduce her
                  sallow complexion. Truly the vital
                  ity of the portrait surpasses all
                  others. American journals commented
                  to this effect: When the Mona Lisa
                  was stolen, the world which never
                  hears of masterpieces took its first
                  lesson in art. How much wbnld a
                  vaudeville manager give for a chance
                  to put aiona usa on his circuitT The
                  Indianapolis News said: "W are glad
                  she Is going back to the Louvre, and
                  some of us are doubtless glad that she
                  can scarcely be threatening to go on
                  the vaudeville stage. And that Is a
                  lure few famous ones can resist these
                  days.- Aside from the slight
                  scratches received in the tool box, the
                  Mona Lisa Is auite unharmed bv her
                   strange adventure.

                  AS
                  —Detective
                  CLAIMED.
                  important discovery
                  among the effects of Vincenzo Perugia,
                  which seems to throw freBh light in
                  his theft of “Mona Lisa." The discovery tends to show that in taking
                  the picture from the Louvre, Perugia
                  was not actuated by purely patriotic
                  matives, as he prteended was the case,
                  and that the theft was long contemplated.
                  Among the mass of miscellaneous
                  papers were two notebooks dated December, 1910, the time when Perugia
                  was employed by a firm of decorators,
                  which was engaged at the Louvre in
                  placing glasses on pictures,
                  writing in the notebooks, the detective says is that of Perugia.
                  The first book contains a list of celebrated multi-millionaires, including
                  the late J. Pierphont Morgan, John D.
                  Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. The
                  second contains a list of art dealers
                  and collectors, not only in the Italian
                  cities of Rome, Florence and Naples,
                  but in Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfort and
                  other German cities. In this list appears the name of Signor Geri, the
                  antiquary of Florence.
                  The police investigations have revealed the fact that Perugia was deeply In love with an exceedingly beautiful girl, the image of “Mona Lisa.”
                  Ninety-three fervent love letters from
                  the girl, signed Mathilde, were found
                  in Perugia's room,
                  some years ago Mathilde was brought
                  to a dance hall by another Italian,
                  who quarreled with and stabbed her
                  and then fled. Perugia witnessed the
                  attack upon the girl, and being struck
                  by her beauty, lifted her into a cab
                  and took her to the home of an old
                  Italian woman, who nursed her back
                  to health.
                  The acquaintance thus begun developed into an ardent love affair. The
                  police hope to obtain from the girl information concerning Perugia which
                  would clear up the question as to
                  whether he had accomplices in the
                  abstraction of the painting from the
                  Louvre. They have so far, however,
                  been unable to find any trace of her.

                  1111. For more than'two years the
                  mystery of the disappearance remained unsolved. In the early part of last
                  winter the painting was recovered
                  through information furnished by an
                  art dealer of Florence, to whom Perugia is said to have offered the picture
                  for sale.
                  At the time of the disappea.ran'ce
                  of the: painting Perugia was employed as a workman at the Louvre and
                  | consequently was enabled to cut the
                  painting, front the frame and carry it
                  from the building without detection.
                  At the time of his arrest in Florence he is alleged to have made a
                  complete confession, giving as his m

                  The Theft of "Mona Lisa."
                  Why a thief should steal property
                  on which he cannot realize is one of
                  those mysteries that occasionally crop
                  up in criminal psychology. What motive a burglar lias for taking a painting is hard to understand at best.
                  Even granting that an occasional
                  criminal has an eye for the artistic,
                  he would have to gratify if in secret,
                  and with the average sneak thief
                  stealing is a matter of business, not
                  sentiment.
                  Vet It appears that "Mona I.isa," or
                  more correctly "La Gioconda." the
                  masterpiece of Leonardo Da Vinci, has
                  been stolen. Perhaps this painting,
                  with the more or less Imperfect copies. photographs and engravings of it.
                  has been loved by more people than
                  any other single work of art in the
                  world. It was a labor of four years
                  by Pa Vinci, and Its first purchaser
                  was a king of France. For years It
                  has hung in the famous Louvre gallery
                  in Paris, where It has been admired
                  literally by millions. If report can be
                  credited, an offer of $5,000,000 was
                  once made for this masterpiece and
                  was declined. It Is one of the few art
                  treasures tt'iit money could not buy.
                  In its place In the vLouvre It -was
                  priceless. In the hands of the thief it
                  Is valueless. Thus the theft represents a total lo?3 to the world.
                  The famous Gainsborough painting
                  was also s;. .en many years ago and
                  was returned long afterward through
                  the efforts of the late Tat Sheedy of
                  New York, who acted as go-between.
                  The loss of "Mona I.i«a" is Infinitely
                  greater, and it is to lie hoped some
                  other Put Sueedy u...y return it to its

                  of last winter the painting was recovered through information furnished by
                  an art dealer of Florence, to whom
                  Perugia is said to have offered the
                  'Picture for sale.
                  At the time-o-f the disappearance of
                  the painting Perugia wag employed as
                  a workman at the Louvre and consequently was enabled to cut thie painting from the frame and carry it from
                  the building without detection. At
                  the time of hia arrest in Florence he
                  is alleged to have made a complete
                  confession, giving as his motive for
                  the theft a desire to revenge himself
                  upon the French for the despoliation
                  of the art galleries of Italy during the
                  Napoleonic invasion.
